E = the experience of playing many games of checkers T = the task of playing checkers. P = the probability that the program will win the next game Algorithms Supervised Learning We give the algorithm &amp;lsquo;right answer&amp;rsquo; to learn Unsupervised learning Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like.</description></item></channel></rss>
