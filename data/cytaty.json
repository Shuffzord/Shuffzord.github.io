It\u2019s because people trust them. They are trusted because the relationships they\u2019ve built and the work they\u2019ve done has compounded. They\u2019ve stuck with the business and shown themselves (in a visible and accountable way) to be high-integrity people. Compound interest also happens in your reputation. If you have a sterling reputation and you keep building it for decades upon decades, people will notice. Your reputation will literally end up being thousands or tens of thousands of times more valuable than somebody else who was very talented but is not keeping the compound interest in reputation going.",

      "Text": "Most of what people think is money is really credit, and credit does appear out of thin air during good times and then disappear at bad times. For example, when you buy something in a store on a credit card, you essentially do so by saying, \u201CI promise to pay.\u201D Together you and the store owner create a credit asset and a credit liability. So where do you take the money from? Nowhere. You created credit. It goes away in the same way. Suppose the store owner rightly believes that you and others won\u2019t pay the credit card company and that the credit card company won\u2019t pay him. Then he correctly believes that the credit \u201Casset\u201D he has isn\u2019t really there. It didn\u2019t go somewhere else; it\u2019s simply gone. As this implies, a big part of the deleveraging process is people discovering that much of what they thought of as their wealth was merely people\u2019s promises to give them money. Now that those promises aren\u2019t being kept, that wealth no longer exists. When",

      "Text": "Readwise helps you remember more of what you read using two principles borrowed from cognitive science: [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) and [active recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall). Spaced repetition is a scientifically proven method for efficient learning that progressively increases the time between reviews of previously learned material. Basically, we remember things better if we spread our reviews out over time rather than cramming. If you stop to think about it, reading a book is kind of like cramming. We intensely learn about a single subject for a few weeks. Then we move onto the next book. Readwise uses your highlights from to space out each book you\u0027ve read into perpetuity. The result is that your retain profoundly more of what you read.",

      "Text": "Why does Readwise focus so much on retention? For the same reasons that founders should reduce churn in a SaaS business before investing in growth; or investors should buffer their portfolios against losses before seeking gains; or bodybuilders should prevent muscle loss before adding lean mass. No matter what you\u2019re doing, the best way to grow is to first prevent losses.\n\nThink of it this way: If you\u0027ve got a leaky bucket, you\u0027re better off fixing the leak before pouring water in the top. For those of you who prefer numbers: If you start with a portfolio worth $100 and lose 50%, you now need to earn 100% to breakeven.\nThis principle, of course, also extends to learning.",
