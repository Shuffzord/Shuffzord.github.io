# Creating a corporate structure

**Problem**: Growing number of projects and lack of the line/product managers causes upper management to work overtime on day to day project work and losing focus on the big picture of the company.

**Thesis**: Introducing middle management will lessen the burden on the higher management and better the quality of communication between growing list of partners

Focus should be on establishing:

- The optimal, most efficient workflow
- Achieving business goals
- Serving customers well

There are many ways by which you can organize your employees:

- By function (sales, marketing, accounting/finance, etc.)
- By region
- By product line

## Questions to be answered

- What is our strategic focus or desired future state?
- What do we want as a company five years from now?
- What is most important to successful execute the strategy?
- What will we have to stop, start or continue to get there?
    - Weekly management meetings
    - Usage of concrete metrics
    - Proper reporting services
    - Full time HR team & clear responsibilities structure between management team
    - Budget tracking
- What do we have to do exceptionally well to win?
- What are the capabilities we need to perform at that exceptional level

Remembering your key business objectives, ask yourself:

- Which roles (current or future) will disproportionately drive the success of the strategy?
- Which roles could be understaffed with little risk to our business?
- What jobs are most vital?
- What current or future skills will disproportionately drive the success of the strategy?
- What capabilities will accelerate our ability to deliver on our promise?
- What knowledge gaps do we have, that may cause any of are plans to fail (ex. train vs  hire people)
- What external factors are there that may put the strategy at risk (ex political / legislation)

**Solution**: Introduction of additional middle management positions, namely project and line managers. SMART plan
(specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound)
steps:

1. Create a weekly management meeting
    1. Eveyrones capacity to execute the plan
    2. Responsibilities
    3. Required training
    4. Budget / Decision schema per plan step
2. Hire Project Managers
    1. Internal recruitment (HR ?)(1 month)
    2. External recruitment (concurrent)(1 month)(HR ?)
    3. project manager per x projects (contract FTE based)

## Metrics success

Workforce planning metrics are information about your workforce that you can track, analyze and leverage to help improve your business, enhance working relationships, proactively plan for the future and lead better. For example, with these metrics you can:

- Assess your organization’s ability and preparedness to reach certain goals
- Identify organizational strengths and challenges
- Confirm placement of the right people in the right roles
- Uncover skill gaps that can hold your organization back from getting where it needs to be
- Make decisions about your staff

### HeadCount

- Turnover rate
- Each manager’s span of control
- Total compensation per employee

Organize workforce by type:

- Full time
- Part time
- Contractor

### Span of control

A subcategory of the headcount metric, span of control provides measures for each manager by answering the following questions:

- How many employees report directly to them?
- How many total employees are within their sphere of influence? For example, do they manage other leaders and therefore have an indirect reporting relationship to all those employees under those leaders?

### Salary rollup

Having an org chart equipped with the salary rollup metric enables executives and HR professionals to:

- Visualize the total cost of their workforce
- Understand how many dollars each leader is responsible for managing on behalf of the organization
- Help ensure pay equity
- Make more accurate budget projections for the coming months, quarters and years

### Tenure and turnover

Tenure is how long an employee has been with an organization. This metric can help you determine whether people are growing and developing, and over what time period. When tenure is rolled up, you can see an average amount of time people are staying with your company.

Turnover is the departure and replacement of an employee. The rate of turnover is how often this happens in a certain time period (e.g., month, quarter or year) and is expressed as a percentage.

It’s also suspicious when high performers unexpectedly quit. When this happens, examining the turnover rates at different levels of your org chart can help to identify the real problem. For example:

- High turnover rates specific to one branch of your org chart may denote poor management.
- Increased turnover among your star players may point to a lack of upward mobility, compensation and benefits that are out of alignment with what the market can bear or some other factor related to individual job roles.

### Performance rating

To analyze this workforce planning metric, you must first have a solid and objective performance-management system for evaluating your employees’ performance.
